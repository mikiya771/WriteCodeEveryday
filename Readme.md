# WriteCodeEveryday

## Why
- to make coding a habit of daily life
- to improve my engineering skill

## How
- I must write code at least 4 times a week.
- It can be nonuseful code, such as refactoring, but documentation is not coding
- The code must be committed to an open source repository on Github.
